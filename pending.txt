async findById(id: string): Promise<Category>{  
    const category = await CategoryModel.findOne({categoryId : id }).lean<Category>()
    if (!category) throw new Error("Category not found"); //remove this line and send null

customize ui of service Management
subCategories to be able change status indipendently

re-make ui for service section in user side /user/service

kyc re-sumbision option 
reject resone to update as array of reason with [ rewiedAt and reviewby and  reason ]  
3 reject (or 3 resone  then reject the user to become a provider )
providerManagment admin can able to see their bookings scedules
