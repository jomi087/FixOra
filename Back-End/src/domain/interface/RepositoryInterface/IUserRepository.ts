/*
    This is how wrote first 
    export interface IUserRepository {
        findByEmail(email: string): Promise <User | null>;
        create(user: User): Promise <void>;

        findByUserId(userId: string): Promise<Omit<User, "password" | "refreshToken"> | null>;
        update(userId:string , updates: Partial<User>) :Promise<Omit <User, "password"|"refreshToken" > | null>
    }
    but there was issue like 
        * design and scalability issues (Your interface is deciding what data to hide (like password) — that’s something your use case or controller should decide, not the interface.)
        * It Becomes Hard to Reuse What if another use case needs the password (e.g., for login) You’d have to write a new method or change this one, which is messy.

        * It Breaks Clean Architecture Rules - Violates Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) Interfaces should define what the repository does  that the responsibilty of interface , it is not supposed to care about how data is shown or hidden. That logic belongs in the repository implementation or the use case, not here.
        * Breaks Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)- If you implement this interface in another context (e.g., with a different DB or mock), your mock might not care about projection — but it still has to mimic this exact structure.

        so either i could wirte the way to jst fetch the data but in some time i dont need the full data that y i am doing it dynamicaly way
